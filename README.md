This is a simple console application to solve wordsearch puzzles. 
It uses a Trie (prefix tree) to quickly find the solution. 100% of this code is under the MIT license so you are free to do... almost anything you want with it. You can generate the documentation with doxygen pointed to Doxyfile.


Requires Cmake and a c/c++ compiler that supports c++14 and C99
